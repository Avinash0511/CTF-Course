# Binary Exploitation / Pwning

### What is it?
In Pwning challenges, you will often be dealing with Linux ELF files (executables), and you
will have to exploit them in some way, typically with buffer overflows.

There a few different exploits you can pull off with buffer overflows:
* [Changing variable values](./variables.md)
* [Shellcode injection](./shellcode.md)
* [Return oriented programming](./rop.md)
* [Return to libc attacks](./libc.md)


### Tools
 * [Pwntools](../Python/pwn.md)
 * [Radare2](./radare2.md)
 * [gdb](./gdb.md)
