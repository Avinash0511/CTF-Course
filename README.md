### Weekly Growth Report
Every week, you should submit a personal growth report following this format: [Report Format](report.md)

### Writeups
You can submit writeups for problems you solve for extra points! A writeup should contain any solution scripts you wrote, and it should walk the reader through the problem while explaining your thought process.

[Example Writeup](https://github.com/zelinsky/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/ISITDTU/Reverse/Recovery/README.md)

Reading writeups are also a great way to learn and go about solving challenges.
