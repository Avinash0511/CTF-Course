basics
-----
pick two primes, p and q.
phi of a number is all of the numbers below that number. since N = p*q, phi(N) is (p-1)*(q-1)
pick a prime (industry standard is 65337) and call that e.
check that gcd(e,p-1)=1 and gcd(e,q-1)=1
multiply p and q and call the result N.
run your message through bytes_to_long() and call that m.
raise m ^ e mod N. call that CT.
