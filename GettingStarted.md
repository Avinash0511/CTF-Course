# Getting Started
Welcome to ELEG 467/667!

In this course we are going to train you to be the best you can at Pentesting and CTF's, from basic Steganography and Cryptography to being experts at binary exploitation. 

## Prerequisites
Please follow the below instructions BEFORE THE FIRST DAY. This will help us land with our feet already running for the first day. We don't have unlimited time and want to get the most out of our time together this summer. Please follow these instructions *exactly*.

#### Installing VMWare (Windows Install)
- Log into [UDeploy](https://udeploy.udel.edu/software/vmware-for-university-of-delaware/)
- Scroll to bottom and click the link that says *To download, please click here to authenticate*
- When logged in, choose VMWare Workstation 15
- On the right side click *Add to cart*.
- This will bring you to a page with a green download button and a serial number. **Copy the serial number** and then click download. It shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes.
- Run the installation file and continue with a normal installation.
- Before hitting finish, click the license button. Paste the license key you copied from earlier.
- Congrats! Let's move to step 2. 

#### Installing Kali Linux
- Download this [Kali Linux VM](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/). I would choose the 64 bit version
- Launch VMWare Workstation or Fusion.
