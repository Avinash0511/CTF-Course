# Class 8: C and Assembly

## Overview
In this lesson, we will look at some code written in c and assembly. We will also write our own basic C programs, compile them, and then disassemble them in order to look at the assembly code and compare it to the original c code.

## Introduction to C
C is a statically typed language, meaning variable types are known at compile time. C leaves a lot open to the interpretation of the programmer, allowing unspecified and undefined behaviors of the program, making it prime for exploitation. However, C is very fast and has been used to solve Crypto challenges in 3 minutes in what would take 30 minutes in python. 

Here's a first program in C that utilizes loops, branching, function definitions, etc so you can familiarize yourself with the language. 
```C 

``` 

To compile this program from the command-line type: 
```shell
gcc -o hello_c hello_c.c
```
To run the program type: 
```shell 
./hello_c arg1 arg2 arg3 
```

Now try running the file command on the executable: 
```shell
file hello_c
```
The output should look similar to this: 
```shell 

``` 
Most computers nowadays are 64-bit, and your executable is most likely a 64-bit executable, but to get started with x86 assembly we will want to have 32-bit programs. In order to do this we have to install the multilib package. 
```shell 
sudo apt-get install multilib 
```

The code can now be compiled into a 32-bit executable with the -m32 flag: 
```shell 
gcc -m32 -o hello_c hello_c.c
```
Running the file command ... 
```shell
file hello_c
``` 
... should now have output similar to this. 
```shell 

```

## Arrays, Malloc and Free, Pointers and Pointer Arithmetic
Arrays in C can be allocated on the stack or on the heap. When arrays are allocated on the stack, the memory remains allocated until the end of the scope of the function or until the program terminates. When arrays are allocated on the heap, the programmer decides when to deallocate the memory, or if they forget it's deallocated at the end of the program. Forgetting to deallocate memory causes poor performance because the memory cannot be used until it is freed up. 

Allocating space for an array on the stack looks like: 
```C
int arr[10]; 
```
When allocating memory on the heap, the programmer must specify the number of bytes needed in the malloc call. To find the size, in bytes, of a C-type, use the sizeof() function. Here's an example of allocating space for an array of size 10 of int on the heap. 
```C 

```
