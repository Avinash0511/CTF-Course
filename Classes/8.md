# Class 8: C and Assembly

## Overview
In this lesson, we will look at some code written in c and assembly. We will also write our own basic C programs, compile them, and then disassemble them in order to look at the assembly code and compare it to the original c code.

## Introduction to C
C is a statically typed language, meaning variable types are known at compile time. C leaves a lot open to the interpretation of the programmer, allowing unspecified and undefined behaviors of the program, making it prime for exploitation. However, C is very fast and has been used to solve Crypto challenges in 3 minutes in what would take 30 minutes in python. 

Here's a first program in C that utilizes loops, branching, function definitions, etc so you can familiarize yourself with the language. 
```C 

``` 

To compile this program from the command-line type: 
```shell
gcc -o hello_c hello_c.c
```
To run the program type: 
```shell 
./hello_c
```

Now try running the file command on the executable like: 
```shell
file hello_c
```
You should see some output like: 
```shell 

``` 
Most computers nowadays are 64-bit, and your executable is most likely a 64-bit executable, but to get started with x86 assembly we will want to have 32-bit programs. In order to do this we have to install the multilib package. 
```shell 
sudo apt-get install multilib 
```

Now recompile your executable with: 
```shell 
gcc -m32 -o hello_c hello_c.c
```
and now when you run file ...  
```shell
file hello_c
``` 
.. you should see something like 
```shell 

```
