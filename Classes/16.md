# Class 16: Diffie-Hellman and Chinese Remainder Theorem

## Overview
In this lesson we will go over the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. We will also take a look at a network capture of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.


## Diffie-Hellman
Looking back at block ciphers, such as DES and AES, they use a shared secret key. Block ciphers use the same key to encrypt and decrypt, so If I have an encrypted message that I want you to decrypt, how do I share the secret key with you?

That's where Diffie-Hellman comes in! Diffie-Hellman allows two people to generate a shared secret together across s public channel, so that anyone listenting to the messages being sent across the channel will not be able to determine the secret.

The reason this works? The **Discrete Log** problem, similarly to RSA. Given the values of <b>A</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>p</b>, with <i>A = g<sup>a</sup> mod p</i>, calculating the value of <b>a</b> is a hard problem.

### The Algorithm
#### Alice
***
* Alice, the initiator, generates a strong prime <b>p</b>
* Alice also generates a base <b>g</b>, which is usually just the number 2
* Alice generates a **private** random number <b>a</b> which shares no factors with <b>p</b>
* Alice calculates a **public** <b>A</b> with <i>A = g<sup>a</sup> mod p</i>
* Alice sends <b>(p, g, A)</b> to Bob, <b>a</b> is kept **private**

#### Bob 
***
* Bob receives <b>(p, g, A)</b> from Alice
* Bob generates a **private** random number <b>b</b> which shares no factors with <b>p</b>
* Bob calculates a **public** <b>B</b> with <i>B = g<sup>b</sup> mod p</i> and sends to Alice

#### Calculating the Secret
***
* With the <b>B</b> received from Bob, Alice computes the shared secret <b>s</b> with <i>s = B<sup>a</sup> mod p</i>
* With the <b>A</b> received from Alice, Bob computes the same shared secret <b>s</b> with <i>s = A<sup>b</sup> mod p</i>

<b>p</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>A</b>, and <b>B</b> are **public** values, and <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>s</b> are **private** values.

Only Alice can compute <i>s = B<sup>a</sup> mod p</i> because only Alice knows <b>a</b>.

Only Bob can compute <i>s = A<sup>b</sup> mod p</i> because only Bob knows <b>b</b>.

Further, Alice is computing <i>s = (g<sup>b</sup>)<sup>a</sup> mod p</i> and Bob is computing <i>s = (g<sup>a</sup>)<sup>b</sup> mod p</i>.

<i>g<sup>ba</sup> = g<sup>ab</sup> mod p</i>


### Try It
>**Pick a partner. One of you will be Alice and the other will be Bob. Perform the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in the Slack channel as described above. Verify that you generated the same secret.**

Here's some Python code to get you started:
```python
from Crypto.Util.number import *

g = 2
p = getStrongPrime(512)
while True:
    a = getRandomRange(2, p-2)
    if GCD(a, p-1) == 1:
	break

A = pow(g, a, p)
```
