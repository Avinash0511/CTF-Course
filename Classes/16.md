# Class 16: Diffie-Hellman

## Overview
In this lesson we will go over the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. We will also take a look at a network capture of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.


## Diffie-Hellman
Looking back at block ciphers, such as DES and AES, they use a shared secret key. Block ciphers use the same key to encrypt and decrypt, so If I have an encrypted message that I want you to decrypt, how do I share the secret key with you?

That's where Diffie-Hellman comes in! Diffie-Hellman allows two people to generate a shared secret together across s public channel, so that anyone listenting to the messages being sent across the channel will not be able to determine the secret.

The reason this works? The **Discrete Log** problem, similarly to RSA. Given the values of `A`, `g`, and `p`, with <b>A = g<sup>a</sup> mod p</b>, calculating the value of `a` is a hard problem.

### The Algorithm
#### Alice
***
* Alice, the initiator, generates a strong prime `p`
* Alice also generates a base `g`, which is usually just the number 2
* Alice generates a **private** random number `a` which shares no factors with `p`
* Alice calculates a **public** `A` with <b>A = g<sup>a</sup> mod p</b>
* Alice sends `(p, g, A)` to Bob, `a` is kept **private**

#### Bob 
***
* Bob receives `(p, g, A)` from Alice
* Bob generates a **private** random number `b` which shares no factors with `p`
* Bob calculates a **public** `B` with <b>B = g<sup>b</sup> mod p</b> and sends to Alice

#### Calculating the Secret
***
* With the `B` received from Bob, Alice computes the shared secret `s` with <b>s = B<sup>a</sup> mod p</b>
* With the `A` received from Alice, Bob computes the same shared secret `s` with <b>s = A<sup>b</sup> mod p</b>

`p`, `g`, `A`, and `B` are **public** values, and `a`, `b`, and `s` are **private** values.

Only Alice can compute <b>s = B<sup>a</sup> mod p</b> because only Alice knows `a`.

Only Bob can compute <b>s = A<sup>b</sup> mod p</b> because only Bob knows `b`.

And looking at `A` and `B`, <b>A = g<sup>a</sup> mod p</b> and <b>B = g<sup>b</sup> mod p</b>, so Alice is computing <b>s = (g<sup>b</sup>)<sup>a<sup></b> and Bob is computing <b>s = (g<sup>a</sup>)<sup>b<sup></b>.

<b>g<sup>ba<sup> = g<sup>ab<sup></b>
