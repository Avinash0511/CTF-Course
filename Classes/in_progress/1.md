# Class X: Forensics and Steganography

## Overview
In this lesson, we will introduce some topics in forensics. We will look specifically at steganography, how it works, some useful tools, and we'll solve some related CTF challenges.

## Forensics
In CTF, forensics challenges cover the following areas:
* Steganography
* File format analysis
* Memory dump analysis
* Network packet capture analysis
* Other forms of examining and extracting information from static data files

### Steganography
