## What are memory dumps?
Memory dumps are created when the host device crashes. When your device crashes and says "gathering some info" it is creating a memory dump and sending it to Microsoft. In the world of cyber security, being able to parse and understand data from memory dumps is a valueable skill to have hence why it was converted into CTF problems.
