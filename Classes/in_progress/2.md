# Class X: File and Memory Dump Forensics

## What are memory dumps?
Memory dumps are created when the host device crashes. When your device crashes and says "gathering some info" it is creating a memory dump and sending it to Microsoft. In the world of cyber security, being able to parse and understand data from memory dumps is a valueable skill to have hence why it was converted into CTF problems.

## What tools will we be using?
For this course, we will teach Volatility. There may be other tools, but 99% of writeups on CTF-Time use this tool.
To install, open your Kali VM's terminal and type:
