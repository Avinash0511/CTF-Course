# Reverse Engineering Practice 

## Overview
In this lecture we will run through a few reversing problems and begin creating a problem solving strategy for reversing problems. 

# Lab1 
You can download the program [here](examples/lab1).

In order to make the program executable run `chmod +x lab1`. 

Before we run our program, it's a good practice to run `file` on our program to see any interesting properties of our executable.

This is just a normal 32-bit ELF file that we have seen in the previous class. 

Now let's execute our program to get a basic idea of how the executable should function.

This program asks for a password, which we gave `123456`, which receives the output `Wrong`. We are looking for functionality that will evaluate our input in some password checker.
