# Class 5 RSA

## Overview
RSA is our first asymmetric key encryption algorithm, meaning the key used for encryption is different than the key used for decryption. In order to encrypt/decrypt with RSA and pull off the various attacks on this algorithm, we need to be comfortable with modular arithmetic in python first.
