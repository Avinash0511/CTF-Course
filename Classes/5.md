# Class 5 RSA

## Overview

RSA is our first asymmetric key encryption algorithm, meaning the key used for encryption is different than the key used for decryption. In order to encrypt/decrypt with RSA and pull off the various attacks on this algorithm, we need to be comfortable with modular arithmetic in python first. 


## Modular Arithmetic
**A Note on Notation**  
> &#8484; refers to the set of integers
> &#8477; refers to the set of real numbers

**Quotient Remainder Theorem** 
> For every integer a and every positive integer b, there exists
> q,r &isin; &#8484; such that 
> a = b&sdot;q + r  0 &le; r &lt; b
> So when we take a (mod b), we get r.
