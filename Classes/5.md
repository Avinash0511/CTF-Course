# Class 5 RSA

## Overview

RSA is our first asymmetric key encryption algorithm, meaning the key used for encryption is different than the key used for decryption. In order to encrypt/decrypt with RSA and pull off the various attacks on this algorithm, we need to be comfortable with modular arithmetic in python first. 


## Modular Arithmetic

<MATH>&int;_a_^b^{f(x)<over>1+x} dx</MATH>
#### Arithmetic Properties 

#### Modular Inverses, GCD, and Euler's Totient Function

## The RSA Algorithm

## Factorization Attacks

**N's Share a Factor**

**Fermat's Factorization Algorithm** 

## Mathematical Attacks

#### Unknown N 
You can't crack RSA if you don't know the modulus ... right??
