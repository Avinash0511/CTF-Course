# Class 5 RSA

## Overview

RSA is our first asymmetric key encryption algorithm, meaning the key used for encryption is different than the key used for decryption. In order to encrypt/decrypt with RSA and pull off the various attacks on this algorithm, we need to be comfortable with modular arithmetic in python first. 


## Modular Arithmetic
**A Note on Notation**  
> &#8484; refers to the set of integers.
>
> &#8477; refers to the set of real numbers.

**Quotient Remainder Theorem** 
> For every integer a and every positive integer b, there exists
> q,r &isin; &#8484; such that 
>
> a = b&sdot;q + r  0 &le; r &lt; b.
> So when we take a (mod b), we get r. 

#### Arithmetic Properties 
**Addition of two integers (mod n)**  
a + b (mod n) &equiv; (a (mod n) + b (mod n)) (mod n) 

**Multiplication of two integers (mod n)** 
a &sdot; b (mod n) &equiv; (a (mod n) &sdot; b (mod n)) (mod n) 

**Subtraction (or the Additive Inverse)**  
When we are dealing with real numbers, and we compute a - b, we are also doing
a + (-b). But negative numbers aren't in our range from 0 &le; x &lt; n, where
n is our modulus. If 0 &le; b &lt; n, then -b = n - b, and instead of 
subtracting we can add (-b). 

If we take n = 30, and we take powers of 29 (mod 30), what pattern do you see?
