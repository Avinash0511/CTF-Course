# Intro to CTF's
Capture the flag as it pertains to our course is much different than the traditional capture the flag you may have played as a kid. In our CTF's, there is a flag hidden somewhere in a server, file, or website. You must use skills learned such as Forensics, Cryptography, Binary-Exploitation, and basic Linux to solve these "problems" to reveal the flag.
Most of the time, flags look like this format:
```
flag{l33t_sp34k-h3r3}
```
Certain categories of CTF's include:
- Cryptography
  - RSA Encryption
  - AES Encryption
- Forensics
  - Steganography
  - Network Traffic
  - Grep
- Binary Exploitation
- Web
- Linux
- Reverse Engineering

### Cryptography Overview

Cryptography is when you take the flag in plaintext and jumble the text in a way that no longer can be understood by someone who intercepts the message, but is performed in an algorythmic way that can be undone by the intended reciever.

Classic Examples of Cryptography are the caesar cipher, rot-13, and the vigenere cipher.
