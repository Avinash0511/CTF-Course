# Web
For Web challenges, you'll be given a link to a webpage, sometimes some source code, and possibly a hint in the challenge title or description. From there, there are many forms the challenge could take on. Web challenges cover a wide range of web-based exploits and tend to focus on bad coding practice, common language vulnerabilities, code injection, and other exploits or web trickery.
