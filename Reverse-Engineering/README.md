# Reverse Engineering

### What is it?
With Reverse Engineering challenges, you will have to take a compiled binary (executable), rip it apart, figure out how it works, and and then control the program to capture the flag. For these challenges, you will need to have a good understanding of assembly code (control flow, loops, and conditionals) as well as debugger and disassembler software.
