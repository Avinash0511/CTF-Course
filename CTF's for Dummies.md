# Intro to CTF's
Capture the flag as it pertains to our course is much different than the traditional capture the flag you may have played as a kid. In our CTF's, there is a flag hidden somewhere in a server, file, or website. You must use skills learned such as Forensics, Cryptography, Binary-Exploitation, and basic Linux to solve these "problems" to reveal the flag.
Most of the time, flags look like this format:
```
flag{l33t_sp34k-h3r3}
```
Certain categories of CTF's include:
- Cryptography
  - RSA Encryption
  - AES Encryption
- Steganography
- Binary Exploitation
