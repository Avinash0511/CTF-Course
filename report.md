3. For problems that you solve provide a brief writeup. 
4. For problems that you didnâ€™t solve, where are you stuck? 
5. List your "a-ha" moments (when something useful clicked for you).
6. What writeups did you read?
7. What is your overall impression of the experience? Which skills do you want to keep in your future?
